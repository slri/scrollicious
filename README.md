# Scrollicious

A little tool to make element manipulation sensitive to scrolling easier. It was originally made for my [portfolio project](https://github.com/slri/yet-another-portfolio) since no other tool had what I needed or included a lot of other functionality which I didn't need. jQuery is required for it to work, but I want to improve it further and get rid of the jQuery dependency.

Implemented some of the best practices for creating front end tools, but there's a lot of room for improvement.
